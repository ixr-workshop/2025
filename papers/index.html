                The Third International Workshop on Interactive Extended Reality (IXR'25) will be held in conjunction with the ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025) in Dublin, Ireland, October 27-31, 2025. 
            </p>
            <h3>About IXR 2025</h3> -->
            <p>
                Over the years the development and optimization of multimedia systems from traditional media (static 2D imagery and 2D video) to immersive media (manipulable 3D and XR) have been tailored towards delivering better experiences in remote communication. This has been essential for enhancing the sensation of presence and interactivity provided by immersive media, where users are no longer passive consumers but assume active engagement and decision-making.  The topic has attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry players, with several publications and patents published every year on the topic, in addition to standardization effort from organizations such as ITU, JPEG and MPEG. </br>
                Despite remarkable advances, current Extended Reality (XR) applications are in their majority local and individual experiences. A plethora of interactive applications, such as teleconferencing, tele-surgery, interconnection in new buildings project chain, Cultural Heritage and Museum contents communication, are well on their way to integrate immersive technologies. However, interconnected, and interactive XR, where participants can virtually interact across vast distances, remains a distant dream.  In fact, three great barriers stand between current technology and remote immersive interactive life-like experiences, namely the (i) content realism, (ii) motion-to-photon latency, and accurate (iii) human centric quality assessment and control.  </br>
                Overcoming these barriers will require novel solutions at all elements of the end-to-end transmission chain. This workshop focuses on the challenges, applications, and major advancements in multimedia, networks and end-user infrastructures to enable the next generation of interactive XR applications and services. We hence encourage original paper submissions, which have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere, from both academia and industry presenting novel research addressing the aforementioned challenges.

            </p>
             <h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Topics of Interest</h3>
            <p>
            We welcome contributions from all research areas on XR, including but not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Novel low latency encoding techniques for interactive XR applications; </li>
                    <li>Novel networking systems and protocols to enable interactive immersive applications. This includes optimizations ranging from hardware (i.e., millimeter-wave networks or optical wireless), physical and MAC layer up to the network, transport and application layers (such as over the top protocols);</li>
                    <li>Significative advances and optimization in 3D modeling pipelines for AR/VR visualization, accessible and inclusive GUI, interactive 3D models;</li>
                    <li>Compression and delivery strategies for immersive media contents, such as omnidirectional video, light fields, point clouds, dynamic and time varying meshes;</li>
                    <li>Quality of Experience management of interactive immersive media applications;</li>
                    <li>Novel rendering techniques to enhance interactivity of XR applications;</li>
                    <li>XR applications and experiences in the era of LLMs: how can AI aid creation and delivery of immersive experiences; </li>
                    <li>Application of interactive XR to different areas of society, such as health (i.e., virtual reality exposure therapy), industry (Industry 4.0), XR e-learning (according to new global aims).</li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We invite researchers, industry experts, and innovators to join us for this exciting workshop on the future of XR,  a unique opportunity to share insights, collaborate, and drive the field forward. Submit your work and be part of the conversation shaping the future of XR!
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top: 20px">Submission guidelines</h3>
           <p>All submissions must be original work not under review at any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers describing completed work as well as work in progress. Two submission formats are accepted: full paper and short paper, which must follow the formatting guidelines of the main conference ACM MM 2025. Full papers should be from 6 to 8 pages (plus 2 additional pages for the references), and will be presented orally. Short papers should be max 4 pages including references, and will be presented as posters. All papers must be encoded as PDF and using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Article Template</a>. The workshop follows a double-blind process: please ensure that your submission is fully anonymised. Failure to comply might result in desk rejection.  For paper guidelines, please visit the conference website.</p>
